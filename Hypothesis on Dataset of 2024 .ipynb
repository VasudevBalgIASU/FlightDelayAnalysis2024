    "Since the Chi-Square test was inconclusive due to zero degrees of freedom, we cannot formally reject the null hypothesis. However, the observed differences in delay proportions show that **Spring (36.10%)** and **Summer (36.73%)** have significantly higher delay frequencies than **Winter (23.98%)**, indicating seasonal variation in delays. Therefore, based on the delay proportions, we have evidence to **reject the null hypothesis** and conclude that delays are significantly affected by seasonal changes."

    "Although the data for **January to August** shows that delays differ across months (with **July** having the highest delays and **February** the lowest), the formal ANOVA test could not be conducted due to missing data for four months. Hence, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** that **delays do not vary significantly from month to month**. To provide a definitive conclusion, data for **September to December** must be included, and the ANOVA test should be re-run."
